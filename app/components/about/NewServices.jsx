      title: "Company Formation",
      about: "Company formation is the legal process of establishing and registering a business entity with the authorities to operate in a specific jurisdiction. In Qatar, it requires approvals from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and other relevant bodies. The process defines the legal structure â€” such as LLC, branch office, or sole proprietorship â€” and involves preparing Articles of Association, choosing a trade name, and securing licenses. Recent regulations allow 100% foreign ownership in many sectors, opening wider opportunities for investors. A properly formed company ensures compliance with laws, tax rules, and labor regulations. It also protects assets, limits liabilities, and builds market credibility. Al Khaldi Law Firm guides clients through every step â€” from planning to final licensing. Our goal is to ensure a smooth, secure, and compliant business setup in Qatar."
